MVVM for Mono

This extension is for use with the Mono for Android and MonoTouch frameworks by Xamarin.
- http://android.xamarin.com/
- http://xamarin.com/monotouch

Current Status:
 - Android has been started, however doesn't compile.
 - iOS has not been started.
 - WP7 has not been started (It requires the core API to integrate with WP7 interfaces nicely)

 We are looking for more people to help develop this project, no matter how small the contribution. Constructive criticism is welcome.
 
Downloads:
 - This package will be avaliable via nuget, but for now is on github only.
